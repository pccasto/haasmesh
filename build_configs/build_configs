Currently very experimental.

These are attempts to create a build configuration for the Luma device (the only one I have) to use against OpenWRT 21.02.

First attempt at least didn't brick the Luma.
Upon upgrade there were a few elements that were automatically converted.

Compared to the original Maxwell it includes a few extra Luci packages and tools.
Don't have the original .config file to compare yet.

Luci Dashboard
Luci opkg -- but doesn't show any available packages beyond installed.

The Luma device has bluetooth. Not sure how that can be used, but added some tools to explore.

The current build is missing some modules, and will need to go through some iterations.
Seemingly missing - alfred & batadv-vis, even though I thought they were included.
the haasmesh wifi does not have encryption, so whatever was providing WPA3 PSK is missing.
